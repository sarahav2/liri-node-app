I created a node.js app called LIRI. LIRI is like SIRI (from an iphone).

It must be ran in the command line.

LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will do any of the below command when you enter them into the command line.

my-tweets
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

Type in node liri.js to get the instructions on how to enter the commands correctly. So if you were to type the below command you'd get the last 20 tweets I have on my account








These are the npm packages I used and are needed to run the app

fs package in node
twitter
spotify
request


to install these npm packages run these commands one at a time.

npm install twitter
npm install spotify
npm install request
